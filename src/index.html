    <p>We view telling stories orally as an art which all people possess to some degree, by virtue of possessing speech or access to its alternatives. Accordingly, we acknowledge that storytelling can range from a hesitant recount of an anecdote over a family meal to a full blown solo concert performance requiring sustained preparation, and underpinned by great artistry and skill.</p>
    <p>While we recognise the value of using notes in public speaking our standard practice at meetings is NOT to use notes for storytelling. Similarly, while we value reading aloud from a book as a skill and art in its own right, we do NOT promote reading aloud as oral storytelling.</p>
