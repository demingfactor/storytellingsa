***[Storylab](https://storylabx.tumblr.com/)***\
A delightful website to sample the variety of storytellers who have been recorded on You-Tube. You can **see** **and hear** live performances, displaying their distinctive styles, usually in live performance situations. Recordings are slightly variable in technical quality, shown within a ‘shell' of a movie screen on your computer. Streaming quality will depend on what speed your computer/modem works, but still worthwhile.

***[Jeff Gere](http://jeffgere.com/)***\
Jeff Gere hails from Honalulu, Hawaii, and is both a multitalented storyteller and  an organiser of festivals and gatherings of storytellers. His enthusiasm, presence, physical expression, and prowess as a performer may stimulate ideas and possibilities for your own telling. His shirts are quite an Hawaiin statement too!

***[The Moth](http://www.themoth.org/)***\
The ‘moth' alludes to people attracted to stories (like moths to lights). This site includes recordings of 5-12 minute personal stories recorded live. The emphasis is on people telling crafted personal stories about their most exceptional experiences. Click on left hand menu **Storytellers** then click on button **Listen to Stories.** No image of the teller.

***[Jackie Kerin (Victorian storyteller)](http://www.jackiekerin.com.au/)***\
Jackie's site includes several very Australian stories which can be located via the pull down ‘Stories' menu at the top. They include: *Shark* (poetry); *Phar Lap The Wonder Horse* (poetry); *A Boy* *Called Ned Kelly* (Prose); *No Horse, No Cart, No Shoes* – set in C19 South Australia (Prose). Her stories which can be either You-Tube viewable or Listenable via Windows Media or equivalent: some are in poetic (ballad form) some are in prose as noted.

***[Now Hear This](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/nowhearthis/)***\
This site enables you to listen to five minute theme-based personal stories which have been recorded as part of the *Now Hear This* regular story-slam competition on Radio National, presented by Melanie Tait. You may also be able to participate as one of eight tellers or as a member of the audience when live slams are held in Canberra and Sydney at this stage.
