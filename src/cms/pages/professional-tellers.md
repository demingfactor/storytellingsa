Professional Tellers

# Professional Tellers

The list below of member storytellers who work professionally, has been made available as a service to the public. While we encourage our tellers to charge the professional rates as established for the performing arts generally, we do not set a standard fee: this is negotiated between the teller and the hirer. Although these tellers have been active members of Storytelling Australia (SA) for at least 6 months, we cannot be responsible for their specific performances and the accuracy of information they have provided.

Graham’s main background is teaching, having taught at all school levels and at University level.  When he left full-time post-graduate teacher education  (TESOL & Literacy ), he continued part time  in post-graduate counsellor & psychotherapist education. In these positions he used and fostered storytelling , educational drama,  multi-cultural and integral perspectives, and the action methods of learning.  Concurrently, he has performed solo as the satirical Professor Bruce Thinkbig at conferences, as a conductor-performer in a Playback Theatre troupe, and as a storyteller in many contexts (eg Medieval & Folk Festivals;  Art Gallery of SA; concerts; weddings)

Currently, Graham is researching several stories associated with the life of the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. Other historical characters and events he has explored previously through storytelling include: Dr Blood (medical doctor Kapunda mines); the Star of Greece (shipwreck), Burke (of Burke & Wills); & Captain Collet Barker (explorer/cultural negotiator). More generally, historical storytelling preoccupies his storytelling imagination, workshops and creative juices.   His totem is the galah !
