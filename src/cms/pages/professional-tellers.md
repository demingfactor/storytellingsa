Professional Tellers

# Professional Tellers

The list below of member storytellers who work professionally, has been made available as a service to the public. While we encourage our tellers to charge the professional rates as established for the performing arts generally, we do not set a standard fee: this is negotiated between the teller and the hirer. Although these tellers have been active members of Storytelling Australia (SA) for at least 6 months, we cannot be responsible for their specific performances and the accuracy of information they have provided.
