**NEXT MEETING** 

**Saturday 22 March 2025** 
**Theme:** "*Harmony*" 

**Location:** Burnside Library - plenty of parking then at reception counter ask "Where is the Storytelling? 

**Time:** 1:15pm for 1:30pm start. Finish  3:30pm

Stories suitable for adults rather than children 

**Background to the theme:**  Every year in March, Australians come together to mark Harmony Week, culminating in the observance of the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on the 21st of March. Australia is one of the world’s most successful multicultural nations. We are home to the world’s oldest continuous cultures as well as migrants from nearly 200 countries. This week schools, workplaces and community groups reflect on this diversity by participating in events across the country and nearly 7,000 people from more than 120 countries will become new citizens. Multiculturalism is integral to our national identity- but we cannot take it for granted.
