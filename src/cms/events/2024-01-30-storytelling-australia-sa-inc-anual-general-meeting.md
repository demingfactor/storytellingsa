**Sunday 11 February 2024GM** 

AGM and Guest Speaker

**1:00 - 2:00pm**  **Lunch** - Bring finger-food to share, unless own picnic box preferred

**2:00 - 2-30pm AGM**

**2:245 - 4:00pm Guest Speaker**

We have a lively speaker who will present (with projected images) some of the sparkling gems she has
uncovered in her historical work and play with Adelaide’s heritage . She will focus particularly on
episodes from the fascinating life of Bert Edwards whose life spanned the 19th and 20th century
Adelaide, the city of churches . Bert was dubbed ‘King of the Westend’, clearly a bigger than life
character who could be jailed for sodomy, be very familiar with the seedy side of pubs, yet rise
socially to become member of parliament.
Our guest speaker has been a professional historian for some 25 years and as such has delved deeply into the
colourful personalities, institutions, and events associated with the emergence of the City of Adelaide.
The results of her wide-ranging explorations can be readily gleaned by sampling her engaging
publications. Invariably, they are readable and well-illustrated, while remaining testaments to the
value of historical truth-telling. As she often insists, what in fact happened in history is often more
interesting and stranger than many fictitious versions in circulation.
 Some of the speakers published books may be available to purchase.
